## 🐛 Known Issues
- None currently

## 📊 Free Tier Limitations & Monitoring
- **Supabase Database**: 500MB storage, 2GB bandwidth/month
- **Supabase Auth**: Unlimited users on free tier
- **Supabase Storage**: 1GB storage, 2GB bandwidth/month  
- **Vercel Hosting**: 100GB bandwidth, unlimited deployments
- **Railway Backend**: 500 hours/month, $5 credit

### Cost Optimization Tips
- Implement image compression before upload
- Use database queries efficiently with proper indexing
- Cache frequently accessed data in localStorage
- Monitor usage in Supabase dashboard weekly

## 🎯 Success Metrics Tracking

- [ ] Authentication flow success rate
- [ ] Profile completion rate
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness score
- [ ] Page load performance metrics

## 📝 Development Notes
- **Mobile-first approach**: All UI components must be mobile-optimized
- **Type safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration throughout
- **Component reusability**: Build with shadcn/ui for consistency
- **Real-time readiness**: Prepare for Socket.IO integration in Phase 4
- **Security focus**: Input validation and secure authentication from start
