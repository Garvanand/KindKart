## üìã Next Steps - Phase 4: Communication & Chat

### Phase 4 Tasks (Weeks 7-8)
1. **Database Connection & Setup**
   - [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database connection
   - [ ] Run Prisma migrations
   - [ ] Configure environment variables

2. **Chat System**
   - [ ] Implement one-on-one messaging between requester and helper
   - [ ] Add real-time messaging with Socket.IO
   - [ ] Create message persistence and history
   - [ ] Build notification system for new messages

3. **Enhanced Authentication**
   - [ ] Integrate real Firebase Auth for OTP
   - [ ] Implement profile photo upload to S3
   - [ ] Add email verification flow

4. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - [ ] Add loading states and error handling
   - [ ] Implement responsive design testing
   - [ ] Add accessibility features

## üêõ Known Issues
- Database connection needs to be configured
- Firebase Auth integration needs real OTP implementation
- Profile photo upload needs AWS S3 integration
- Environment variables need to be set up for both frontend and backend

## üìä Free Tier Limitations & Monitoring
- **Supabase Database**: 500MB storage, 2GB bandwidth/month
- **Supabase Auth**: Unlimited users on free tier
- **Supabase Storage**: 1GB storage, 2GB bandwidth/month  
- **Vercel Hosting**: 100GB bandwidth, unlimited deployments
- **Railway Backend**: 500 hours/month, $5 credit

### Cost Optimization Tips
- Implement image compression before upload
- Use database queries efficiently with proper indexing
- Cache frequently accessed data in localStorage
- Monitor usage in Supabase dashboard weekly

## üéØ Success Metrics Tracking
- [ ] User registration completion rate
- [ ] Authentication flow success rate
- [ ] Profile completion rate
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness score
- [ ] Page load performance metrics

## üìù Development Notes
- **Mobile-first approach**: All UI components must be mobile-optimized
- **Type safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration throughout
- **Component reusability**: Build with shadcn/ui for consistency
- **Real-time readiness**: Prepare for Socket.IO integration in Phase 4
- **Security focus**: Input validation and secure authentication from start
